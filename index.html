Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus congratulated the Bangladesh national women's football team for clinching the title of the SAFF championship in Nepal on Wednesday.

"Great achievement of our women football team," he said in a statement.

"I am proud of you. The whole nation is proud of you. Congratulations to all the players who brought us this glory," Prof Yunus said.

Bangladesh's women's football team made history Wednesday, securing their second consecutive South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Women's Championship title with a 2-1 victory over host nation Nepal at Kathmanduâ€™s Dashrath Rangasala Stadium.

In a repeat of their 2022 triumph, Bangladesh once again defeated Nepal in the final, cementing their unbeaten streak in the seven-nation tournament.
